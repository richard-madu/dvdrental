--Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all movies are rented for.
--Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories
--You should only need the category, film_category, and film tables to perform this task
--Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into
SELECT
  f.title film_title,
  c.name cname,
  f.rental_duration,
--use ntile window function to get the standart quartile
  NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY f.rental_duration) AS standard_quartile
FROM film f
--JOIN film_category
JOIN film_category fc
  ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
--JOIN category
JOIN category c
  ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
--Fliter to include family movies only
WHERE c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
